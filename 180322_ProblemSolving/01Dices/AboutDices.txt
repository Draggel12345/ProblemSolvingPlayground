Description:
In this exercies I create a little console game where there are two players
throwing their dice five times each and the player with the highest total score wins!

Codeprocess:

Check out the code comments for more detailed info.

First I created the class named Dice, for creating a dice and methods for the dice.

Then I created a second class which is static named RunDice, where I setup the game.

And in the end i'm using RunDice in Program.cs to run the game.
